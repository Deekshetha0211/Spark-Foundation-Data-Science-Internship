## Task-1 Predict the percentage of an student based on the no. of study hours 

Using simple linear regression model, forecasting the marks of a student based on the numbers of hours studied per day :computer:

_**Tool(s) Used - Python (Google Colab)**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
The problem statement and the predictions that are to be made:

1. Predict the percentage of marks of an student based on the number of study hours.

2. This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just 2 variables.

3. Data can be found at :point_right: http://bit.ly/w 

4. You can use :writing_hand: R, Python, SAS Enterprise Miner or any other tool.

5. What will be predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/ day?
